Multidimensional Cubic Bspline Library

This package includes two directories:
- Code: source code for multidimensional cubic Bspline implementation and a couple of tests (c++ and matlab). 
- Data: data to test the software. 
 
For details about compiling and running the software, and the data format, please refer to the readme files in the proper directory.

The latest version of the code, together with manuals and terms of use can be found at: http://code.google.com/p/mcbs/
